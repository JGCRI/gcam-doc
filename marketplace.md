## Description

GCAM operates by determining a set of prices that ensure supply is equal to demand for all time steps. The marketplace collects the supplies and demands and uses [solver algorithms](solver.html) to determine those prices.

## Policy options 

This section summarizes some of the marketplace policy options available in GCAM. 

### Carbon or GHG prices

GCAM users can directly specify the price of carbon or GHGs. Given a carbon price, the resulting emissions will vary depending on other scenario drivers, such as population, GDP, resources, and technology. See [example](policies_examples.html#carbon-price).
