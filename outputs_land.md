Outputs are specified in the `startVisitLandLeaf` and `startVisitCarbonCalc` methods of [xml_db_outputter.cpp](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/cvs/objects/reporting/source/xml_db_outputter.cpp).

<a name="table_footnote">1</a>: There is a long list of standard queries that report land allocation outputs. The "detailed land allocation" query will list land for every single land leaf and region combo (see <a href="details_land.html#land-nesting-strategy">land nesting</a> for a complete list of land leafs). The "aggregated land allocation" query listed above will aggregate land into 12 categories (e.g., crops, biomass, etc.). There are also queries that will return land allocation for an individual GLU ("land allocation in a specified land use region") or total land by crop ("land allocation by land crop"). <br/>
