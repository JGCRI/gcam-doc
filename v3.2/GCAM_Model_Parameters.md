Overview
--------

This list of tables includes all numerical parameters in the GCAM XML input and output files. The tables do not include parameters that are input as text, nor parameters that are input as attributes to XML&nbsp;tags (e.g. name = ""). The tables indicate where each parameter is located in the XML structure, with levels in the heirarchy indicated by "/", references to specific sectors indicated by ":". The descriptions are qualitative; no equations of the different parameters are included in this document. The units column indicates the unit for the parameter, and the default column indicates the model default value if the user does not read in any value. Additional clarifying notes are provided in several instances.
