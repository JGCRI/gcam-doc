GCAM v6.0 [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6619287.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6619287):
1. A new residential floorspace expansion model.
2. Bio-energy updates: additional limits to "unsustainable" deployment
3. Default hotelling rate for climate stabilization scenarios is now 3%.
4. Split out 6 detailed industrial sectors from the aggregate industry sector.
5. Updated Hydrogen production, distribution, and end-use technologies.
6. A new protected lands definition.
7. Expanded crop commodities.
8. Use spatially explicit soil and vegetation carbon data from Moirai.
9. HFC MAC curve fixes.
10. New pollutant emissions controls.
11. Add direct air capture as a mitigation option in GCAM-USA.
12. Gross electricity trade in GCAM-USA.
13. Add GHGs to GCAM-USA.
14. Add pollutant emissions to GCAM-USA.
15. Solution improvements, particularly related to water markets.
16. Change the XML parser library to RapidXML.
17. Add the ability to exit the model early due to solution failure.
18. Reduce memory usage (offsets additional memory from expanded crop commodities).
19. `gcamdata`: Renv and user modification chunks.

GCAM v5.4: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5093192.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5093192)

Several changes have been made to GCAM since the last release version (v5.3). The key updates are:
 1. Updated technology costs for electricity and transportation technologies
 2. Emissions: using CEDS as data source, updated to 2015, new MAC curves
 3. Trade: improved trade for fossil fuels, forestry, and agriculture
 4. Included water markets in GCAM-USA
 5. Energy for water
 6. New food demand representation
 7. Solver improvements and library changes
 8. gcamdata updated to use drake and work with dplyr 1.0.0
 9. Removed unused code
 10. Minor updates and bugfixes
 11. Optional features (not turned on by default):   
	- Direct Air Capture  
	- Ability to specify exogenous floorspace pathways  
	- Ability to scale CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions to EPA inventories
