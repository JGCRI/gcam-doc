GCAM's supply inputs include information on production, prices, technology cost and performance, and other emissions in the historical period in order to calibrate model parameters. In addition, GCAM's supply modeling requires information on future technology cost and performance and emissions factors for future periods. GCAM requires that supply data is globally consistent with [demand data](inputs_demand.html) for each of its historical model periods as it solves for market equilibrium in these years as it does for future years. These inputs are required for each [region](common_assumptions.html#regional-resolution) and [historical year](common_assumptions.html#historical-years).

#### Data

Throughout GCAM, the number in the name of assumption file indicates to which sector the file applies. Files with `A10` through `A20` in the name are assumptions for resources. Files with `A21` and `A22` in the name are assumptions for refining and gas processing. Files with `A23` in the name are assumptions for electricity, `A24` is for heat, and `A25` is for hydrogen. Files with `A26` in the name are assumptions for transmission and distribution. Files with `A61` in the name are assumptions about carbon storage.

##### Historical supply of energy

GCAM uses IEA energy balances as a source for historical energy supply and demand. IEA data are proprietary and thus are not provided in the GCAM data repository. Instead, we provide all of the `R` code used to process the IEA data so that the user can replicate the processing _if_ they purchase the IEA data. In addition, we provide aggregated data after it has undergone processing so that GCAM input files can be created and used by the user community.

</font>

<br/>

Note that for the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), different inputs are used for some variables. See [SSPs](ssp.html) for more information.

#### Data

#### Surface water supply curves
Surface water supply curves are based on runoff estimates from Xanthos, a detailed global hydrology model ([Liu et al. 2018](#liu2018); [Vernon et al. 2019](#vernon2019)). Xanthos accounts for surface and subsurface processes to compute runoff at 0.5° grid resolution. Global climate datasets are utilized in conjunction with Xanthos to determine historical annual average runoff aggregated for each basin ([Liu et al. 2018](#liu2018); [Turner et al., 2019a](#turner2019a); [Vernon et al. 2019](#vernon2019)). Of the total basin runoff, water available or accessible for human use takes into consideration requirements for ecosystem services, inaccessibility due to rapid flow and remote locations, and capacity of reservoir storage. Accessible fractions of total runoff vary across basins. Renewable water volumes up to the accessible fraction is available at nominal or low cost. Additional renewable water beyond the accessible fraction is available at a sharply higher cost to ensure availability of water for ecosystem services and to reflect capital investments necessary for reservoir expansion.
Basin level runoff is specified in [xanthos_basin_runoff.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/water/xanthos_basin_runoff.csv). 
Accessible fraction is specified in [xanthos_accessible_water.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/water/xanthos_accessible_water.csv).
For additional accessible calculations, basin historical basin level demands are specified in [basin_water_demand_1990_2015.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/water/basin_water_demand_1990_2010.csv) and groundwater availability is specified in [groundwater_trend_watergap.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/water/groundwater_trend_watergap.csv).

#### Groundwater supply curves
Non-renewable groundwater supply curves are modeled as a graded depletable resource with a fixed amount of total groundwater availability. Basin level estimates of environmentally exploitable groundwater are aggregated from grid-scale data. Groundwater supply curves represent the relationship between exploitable groundwater and cost of extraction. As the available water within the initial grades is exhausted, the price for additional groundwater resources increases as a function of depth and geological complexity. Energy inputs and costs required for pumping are included for a rigorous estimate of the relationship between groundwater volume and extraction cost ([Turner et al., 2019a](#turner2019a); [Kim et al. 2016](#kim2016)).
Graded groundwater availability is specified in [groundwater_constrained.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/water/groundwater_constrained.csv) with groundwater extraction trends found in [groundwater_trend_watergap.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/water/groundwater_trend_watergap.csv) and [groundwater_trend_gleeson.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/water/groundwater_trend_gleeson.csv).

#### Desalination costs
The costs of desalinated water reflects electrical energy input and capital and operational costs. Due to the high cost of desalination, desalinated water is only utilized when renewable and non-renewable water supplies are scarce and the cost of freshwater is high. Desalinated water representation is nested within the water distribution sectors where it competes with basin water supply from renewable and nonrenewable sources.

#### Data

##### Historical production and harvested area

For both production and harvested area of crops, GCAM blends country level time series provided by the FAO with subnational information provided by [moirai](https://github.com/JGCRI/moirai) in a single year to determine historical production and harvested area for each [GCAM land region](common_assumptions.html#regional-resolution). FAO data is specified in [FAO_ag_Prod_t_PRODSTAT.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/FAO/FAO_ag_Prod_t_PRODSTAT.csv) and [FAO_ag_HA_ha_PRODSTAT.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/FAO/FAO_ag_HA_ha_PRODSTAT.csv). Moirai data is specified in [LDS_ag_prod_t.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/LDS/LDS_ag_prod_t.csv) and [LDS_ag_HA_ha.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/LDS/LDS_ag_HA_ha.csv). Livestock production is specified in [FAO_an_Prod_t_PRODSTAT.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/FAO/FAO_an_Prod_t_PRODSTAT.csv).

##### Livestock feed information

GCAM bases its historical livestock feed representation on the IMAGE model. GCAM requires information on [input-output coefficients](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/IMAGE/IMAGE_an_FeedIO_Rimg_C_Sys_Y.csv), [feed fractions](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/IMAGE/IMAGE_an_Feedfrac_Rimg_C_Sys_Fd_Y.csv), and [production mixes](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/IMAGE/IMAGE_an_Prodmixfrac_Rimg_C_Y.csv).

##### Ag productivity growth

GCAM captures change in yield due to increases in fertilizer use or irrigation endogenously. All other non-climate related factors driving yield increases are exogenously specified, with data specified in [FAO_ag_CROSIT.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/FAO/FAO_ag_CROSIT.csv).

##### Prices

GCAM uses producer prices to initialize the model (future prices are endogenous). Those prices are provide in [FAO_ag_an_ProducerPrice.csv.gz](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/FAO/FAO_ag_an_ProducerPrice.csv.gz).


##### Cost of production

The costs associated with land, irrigation, and fertilizer are endogenously determined in GCAM (see [Land Supply](supply_land.html)). Other costs of production are exogenously specified and the data used for those costs can be found in [USDA_cost_data.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/USDA_cost_data.csv), with [USDA_item_cost.csv](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/aglu/USDA_item_cost.csv) specifying which costs are included in GCAM. Note that we use cost information for the USA in all regions.

##### Emissions 

Historical non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions information is provided in the GCAM release as "pre-built" data aggregated to GCAM regions, technologies, and fuels. Users that want to build using CEDS raw data, for example to build for different regional aggregations, will need to generate CEDS data using the open-source [CEDS system](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS) and place the resulting emissions data by country, fuel, and sector within the [CEDS folder](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/blob/master/input/gcamdata/inst/extdata/emissions/CEDS).
