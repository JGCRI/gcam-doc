At each time step, GCAM searches for a vector of prices that cause all
markets to be cleared and all consistency conditions to be satisfied.
The mapping from input prices to output market disequilibria is a
vector function $$\vec y = F(\vec p)$$.  The GCAM solver is responsible
for finding the root of this equation; that is, the point at which
$$F(\vec p) = 0$$.

GCAM has several solver algorithms at its disposal. The solver
algorithms can be combined so that several of them are used in
sequence. The mix of algorithms can be varied from one model timestep
to the next and can be customized for markets that require special
treatment. Additionally, each solver algorithm has several adjustable
parameters that are user configurable. These configuration options are
specified in the
[solver configuration file](#Solver-Configuration-File).

### Bisection Solver

#### Description

The bisection solver is a multidimensional generalization of 
one-dimensional bisection methods. The one-dimensional methods work by
first establishing a bracket, identified by a change of sign in
$$f(x)$$, around the solution. At each iteration $$f(x)$$ is evaluated
at the midpoint of the bracket interval, and the sign of the result
tells us which half of the interval contains the solution. The
endpoints of the bracket are adjusted to the newly-identified
interval, and the iterations continue until the interval is small
enough that we have effectively isolated the solution.

For a system of equations in multiple dimensions, it is generally not
possible to construct a rigorous bracket around a solution. Even if we
find two points for which all of the equations in the system have
opposite sign, there is no guarantee that a solution exists somewhere
on the line connecting the two points. The reason why is that the
solution to the equation $$\vec F(\vec x) = 0$$ is a single point
$$\vec x_0$$ where all components of $$\vec F$$ are simultaneously
zero. As we move from one of our putative bracket points to the other
the overwhelming likelihood is that the components of $$\vec F$$ will
change sign at different places along the path, none of which will be
the solution we seek. Thus, in general, bracketing and bisection is
not a viable strategy for solving a system of equations.

Despite this shortcoming, bisection can often be used to get the
solver into the general vicinity of the solution, from which one of the
other solvers can easily find it. For initial guesses far from
the solution, bisection can often be faster than more sophisticated
solution techniques. Moreover, bisection places no conditions on the
partial derivatives of $$F$$, making it useful for jostling the solver out of
singular regions. These two properties make bisection a useful
technique for getting a solution started, before finishing with
another technique.

#### Parameters

* **bracket-interval**: The amount by which the bracket boundary will
be increased or decreased when attempting to bracket the
solution. This is a multiplicative factor, so a bracket interval of
$$f$$ means that we will increase prices by multiplying by $$1+f$$ and
decrease them by dividing by $$1+f$$.  
* **max-bracket-iterations**: The
maximum number of steps the solver will take when attempting to
bracket the solution.  
* **max-iterations** : The maximum number of
bisection iterations the solver will perform before giving up.  
* **solution-info-filter** : A
[solution info filter](#Solution-info-filter_Predicates) predicate
that will be used to determine which markets the solver will attempt
to solve.  

### Broyden's Method Solver

#### Description

The Broyden Solver is a globally convergent iterative method
based on the one in *Numerical Recipes*, section
9.7<sup>[1](#NR)</sup>. In each iteration we solve the
equation

$$  
B(\vec x) \cdot \delta \vec x = -\vec F(\vec x) \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; (1) 
$$  

for a correction step $$\delta \vec x$$, where $$B$$ is a secant
approximation to the Jacobian matrix of first derivatives of $$\vec
F$$. Using an approximate Jacobian allows us to reduce the number of
finite-difference Jacobian matrices compared to what would be required
if we used the exact Jacobian, $$J$$, in equation (1).  Computing an
exact finite-difference Jacobian in GCAM is a very expensive process,
so using the secant approximation results in tremendous computational
savings.

In each iteration of the Broyden algorithm, we update $$B$$ using the
results of the computations in the previous iteration.  We solve
equation (1) for an iteration step $$\delta \vec x$$, and we update
$$\vec x$$ to $$ \vec x + \delta \vec x$$.  This process is iterated
until $$\vec F$$ is sufficiently small.

The procedure just described will often fail to converge when $$\vec
x$$ is far from its solution value. This problem is particularly
evident in functions that have rapidly changing or discontinuous
derivatives and in functions where the Jacobian matrix is nearly
singular. In these situations, equation (1) attempts to extrapolate
local information about the gradient of the function to distant
regions where it is invalid. Such a step can easily land the solver in
an unusual region of the parameter space (*i.e.,* a region for which
the model is ill-behaved or undefined), and when this happens the
algorithm rarely recovers.

We mitigate these problems by monitoring $$ f = \|\vec F\| $$ and
backtracking along the direction of $$ \delta \vec x$$ when an
ordinary iteration step causes $$ f$$ to increase. This allows
the solver to follow the step far enough to progress toward the
desired solution, while rejecting large steps that take us further
away from it. Computationally we implement this procedure by scaling
the iteration step by a factor $$ \lambda \leq 1$$ . We start
each iteration with $$ \lambda = 1$$ and evaluate $$ f$$ . If it has
failed to decrease sufficiently, we decrease $$ \lambda$$ until we
obtain an acceptable step. The heuristic for accepting a step and the
procedure for decreasing $$ \lambda$$ are described in *Numerical
Recipes*.<sup>[1](#NR)</sup>

**Because the Broyden solver is the only solver algorithm that can drive
the system all the way to a solution, it should always be included in
the configuration.**  Failure to do so will almost always result in a
failure to solve.

#### Limitations

The backtracking procedure greatly enhances the convergence properties
of the solver over the basic procedure, but the solver will still fail
under some circumstances. The most commonly occurring such
circumstance is a singular Jacobian caused by one or more prices
having no impact on the excess demand in any of the solved markets. In
GCAM this situation occurs predictably at high and low price
extremes. Many of the input supply and demand functions saturate in
extreme price regimes, leading to zero derivatives. One of the ways
GCAM deals with this problem is by excluding markets with obvious price
extremes from the Broyden solver and using other solver algorithms on
them until their prices come into the normal price domain.

#### Parameters

* **ftol**: Convergence criterion for the solver. The solver is
  considered converged when the magnitude of the largest component of $$
  \vec F$$  is less than ftol.  
* **max-iterations**: Maximum number of iterations of the main loop to
  execute before giving up. This is only loosely related to the number
  of evaluations used as a criterion in the
  [general parameters](#General-Solver-Parameters).  In an iteration
  with no backtracking, the algorithm will make a single evaluation.
  An iteration that backtracks may take anywhere from two evaluations
  to a dozen or more.  In some particularly difficult cases the
  algorithm may beforced to compute a finite-difference Jacobian,
  which will count for approximately $$N/10$$ evaluations, where $$N$$
  is the total number of markets and constraints being solved (usually
  a few hundred). 
* **solution-info-filter** : A
  [solution info filter](#Solution-info-filter-Predicates) predicate
  that will be used to determine which markets the solver will attempt
  to solve.  

### Newton-Raphson (NR) Solver

This solver is a predecessor to the Broyden solver, which supersedes
it.  The NR solver is deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in the next
GCAM release.  The Broyden solver should be used instead.

### Preconditioner

Though the Preconditioner is treated as a solver its purpose is not to
solve the GCAM system as such; rather it is a supplement to the other
algorithms that attempts to modify initial guesses to avoid problems
associated with singular matrices.  It does this by exploiting things
that we know about the GCAM system, such as the fact that most
resource supply curves have a turn-on price, below which none of the
resource will be produced.  Therefore, including the Preconditioner in
the solver configuration can often prevent solution failures and cause
periods to solve in fewer iterations.  

#### Parameters

* **max-iterations**: The preconditioner can make either one or two
  passes over the system.  The heuristics used on the second pass are
  slightly different than those used on the first pass.  It is not
  useful to perform more than two passes   
* **ftol**: Increment by which an initial guess is set inside the
  allowable range of an input price, when the original guess was
  outside the allowable range.  
* **solution-info-filter** : A
  [solution info filter](#Solution-info-filter-Predicates) predicate
  that will be used to determine which markets will be
  preconditioned.
  
In addition to these, the parser also recognizes the tokens
  **price-increase-fac**, **price-decrease-fac**, and
  **large-price-thresh**; however, none of these are currently used.

Solver Configuration File 
-------------------------

The solver configuration, including the choice of solver or solvers to
use and settable solver parameters, is selected in the solver
configuration file. This file is specified in the input Configuration
file using a line of the form:

`<Value name="solver_config">../input/solution/cal_solver_config.xml</Value>`

### Syntax

The solver configuration file comprises a series of blocks that
specify the configuration of the solver to use in each period of the
model run. For example:  

```
 <user-configurable-solver year="2005">
       <solution-tolerance>0.001</solution-tolerance>
       <solution-floor>0.0001</solution-floor>
       <calibration-tolerance>0.01</calibration-tolerance>
       <max-model-calcs>2500</max-model-calcs>
        .
        .
        .
</user-configurable-solver>
```

The first line indicates that this is the configuration to be used
in 2005. If the same solver configuration is to be used for all
subsequent years, we can add the "fillout" parameter:

`<user-configurable-solver year="2010" fillout="1">`

The first few lines of the configuration specify
[General Solver Parameters](#General-Solver-Parameters), which apply
to all solver components. For the most part, these parameters dictate
things like stopping conditions, which apply to all of the solver
components that will be used.

Following the general parameters are one or more blocks that specify
solver components, which direct the solver to run particular solution
algorithms. For example:  

```
       <broyden-solver-component>
           <max-iterations>25</max-iterations>
           <ftol>1.0e-3</ftol>
           <solution-info-filter>solvable-nr || (market-type="Tax" &amp;&amp; solvable)</solution-info-filter>
       </broyden-solver-component>
```

The first few lines specify parameters that are specific to this
particular solver component. The `solution-info-filter` line gives a
[predicate](#Solution-info-filter-Predicates) for determining which
markets the component will attempt to solve. This filter allows us to
exclude from a solver component markets that are likely to cause that
component to fail (for example, markets that make the Jacobian matrix
singular for the Broyden solver) or whose solution is unlikely
to be improved by the component.

The algorithms will be run consecutively in the order listed in the
configuration file. When all have been run, the termination criteria
will be checked. The sequence of components will be repeated until
either the model is solved or the maximum number of model evaluations
has been exceeded.

<a name="General-Solver-Parameters"></a>

### General Solver Parameters

* **calibration-tolerance**: During the calibration periods, the
  tolerance for determining whether or not the calibration was
  successful.
* **max-model-calcs**: The maximum number of times the full model will
  be evaluated in the course of the solution. If the solver has not
  found a valid solution by that time, it exits and issues a warning.  
* **solution-tolerance**: The relative excess demand threshold, below
  which the model is considered solved. Loosely speaking, this is the
  accuracy to which we wish to solve the model.  It should be set
  greater than or equal to the `ftol` parameter in the Broyden solver
  component, so that any candidate solution returned by the Broyden
  algorithm will be guaranteed to pass this test as well.  
* **solution-floor**: The absolute excess demand threshold, below
  which the model is considered solved. This parameter covers the
  cases where a low demand value makes achieving a relative excess
  demand threshold unfeasible.  

<a name="Solution-info-filter-Predicates"></a>

### Solution-info-filter Predicates

The predicates available to filter markets are:

* **all**: True for any market.  
* **market-name**: True if the name of the market matches the name
  given in the filter.  
* **market-type**: True if the type of the market matches the type
  given in the filter. The available market types are Normal,
  Calibration, Inverse-Calibration, Tax, RES, Subsidy,
  [Trial-Value, Demand, and Price](Cycle-breaking-in-GCAM.html).  
* **solvable**: True for markets that should be solved. "Solvable" in
  this context refers to intent, not capability. A market is
  "solvable" if its price is an independent variable (*i.e.*, not
  determined by another market). Additionally, constraint markets
  (*e.g.*, greenhouse gas caps) are "unsolvable" when the constraint
  is not binding.
* **solvable-nr**: True for markets that should be solved and meets
  the criteria for solving with a Broyden solver. For most
  markets these criteria are that the price and supply are
  nonzero. (Exception: trial-value markets are exempt from the nonzero
  price and supply requirements.)
* **unsolved**: True for markets that are not yet solved.  

Predicates can be combined with the logical operators **and** (&&)
(*NB:* Since the & character is reserved in XML, it must be written as
`&amp;amp;`), **or** (||), and **not** (!) to form compound
predicates. These conjunctions can be grouped with parentheses. 

For example:

` <solution-info-filter>solvable-nr || (market-type="Tax" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; solvable)</solution-info-filter>`

or

` <solution-info-filter>unsolved &amp;amp;&amp;amp; solvable &amp;amp;&amp;amp; `  
`      !(market-name="globalcrude oil" || market-name="globalnatural gas" || market-name="globalcoal") </solution-info-filter>`  

The first of these would accept all solvable-nr markets and all
solvable tax markets (even if they don't meet the NR
requirements). The second would exclude the global crude oil, natural
gas, and coal markets and accept all other solvable markets that are
not yet solved.

## Advanced Solver Details


### Compile-time configuration options

In order to compute its iteration step, the Broyden solver must solve
equation (1) for $$\delta \vec x$$.  In GCAM's default configuration
it does this using an L-U Decomposition subroutine provided in the
Boost libraries.  L-U Decomposition is quick, but it has no way to
recover from a singular Jacobian matrix.  Worse, in cases where the
Jacobian matrix is formally not singular, but is nevertheless badly
ill-conditioned, the algorithm can spend many iterations generating
iteration steps that are badly corrupted by roundoff error.  Sometimes
the algorithm can recover from such a situation, and sometimes not,
but either way it wastes a lot of time.

To combat this effect, we developed a version of the solver that uses
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).  The idea behind SVD is to use
more sophisticated linear algebra techniques to detect and filter out
components of $$\delta \vec x$$ that are corrupted by ill-conditioning
in the Jacobian matrix.  SVD is a more complex algorithm than L-U and
takes longer to compute, but the iterations saved can more than offset
the additional computational cost.

To use SVD you must have LAPACK and BLAS libraries installed, along
with the
[Boost numeric bindings](http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/numeric_bindings-v1/).
There are many implementations of LAPACK and BLAS available, but some
of them are better than others.  In general, you shouldn't try to use
LAPACK with GCAM unless you have access to a vendor-supplied
implementation, such as the Intel Math Kernel Libraries (MKL).

The SVD solver must be selected at compile time.  If you have an old
GCAM build in your workspace you will have to run `make clean` to
clear out the old object files.  You will also need to set the
following environment variables:

```
export USE_LAPACK=1
export BOOST_NUMERIC_BINDINGS=/path/to/numeric/binding/sources
```

If you are using MKL, additionally set the following environment
variables:

```
export MKL_CFLAGS=-fopenmp -I/path/to/mkl/include/files
export MKL_LDFLAGS=-fopenmp -L/path/to/mkl/lib -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_core -lmkl_gnu_thread -ldl -lpthread -lm
export MKL_RPATH=-Wl,rpath,/path/to/mkl/lib
```

If you are using some other LAPACK, you must instead set (assuming
that LAPACK and BLAS are installed in the same place):

```
export LAPACKINC=/path/to/lapack/include/files
export LAPACKLIB=/path/to/lapack/library/files
```

Once you have set up the environment, building with `make gcam` will
build the LAPACK-enabled version of GCAM.  If you are using a version of
LAPACK that you provided, then that is all you have to do; you can run
GCAM with LAPACK normally.  If you are using MKL, then there is some
run-time environment setup you should do.  While not strictly
required, these settings will give you better performance in the SVD
subroutines (replace NN with the number of processors you have):

```
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
export MKL_DOMAIN_NUM_THREADS="BLAS=NN"
```



### Model abstraction layer 

For newer solver algorithms, the GCAM solver is decoupled from the
rest of the GCAM model by an abstraction layer that presents the model
to the solver as a vector function of a single vector argument: $$
\vec y = \vec F(\vec x)$$ . Both vectors have length equal to the
number of solved markets. The input vector $$ \vec x$$ is the log of
the prices (or price-analogs, for special markets that redefine the
price method). The output vector $$ \vec y$$ is the excess demand (or
analog, for markets that redefine it), $$ \vec y = D-S$$ .  The
abstraction layer also takes care of scaling inputs and outputs to a
common order of magnitude and making additional corrections for
certain special cases.

The solver is mostly unaware of the details of how the input vector is
processed for use in the model or how the model is invoked. The sole
exception is the `partial` method, which allows the solver to signal
that it is computing a partial derivative. This allows the abstraction
layer to optimize the model computation by skipping the calculation of
values that have not changed. It does not affect the results returned.

The abstraction layer takes care of all of the manipulations that have
to happen to get the model to run with a set of input prices. In
order, these are:

-   Zeroing all market supplies and demands *(full calculation only)*.
-   Saving the current market values and setting flags *(partial calculation only)*.
-   Determining the affected nodes *(partial calculation only)*
-   Converting from log price to price.
-   Calling `world->calc()`
-   Converting from excess demand to log excess demand.
-   Restoring any state that was modified.

This arrangement greatly simplifies the development of solver
algorithms and eliminates redundant code that was formerly duplicated
in each algorithm. Some older algorithms bypass the abstraction layer
and perform these tasks directly. Over time, these solvers will be
phased out and replaced with versions that call the model through the
abstraction layer.
