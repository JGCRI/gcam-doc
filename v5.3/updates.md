Several changes have been made to GCAM since the last release version (v5.2). The key updates are:

1. GCAM's final historical year has been updated to **2015**.
2. GCAM has been renamed to the "Global Change Analysis Model".
3. Livestock trade has been updated to use an Armington-style approach, instead of fixing trade at historic values.
4. A number of bug fixes (e.g., a correction to the MAC technical change) and minor enhancements (e.g., adding the `stop-year` capability)
